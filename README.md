# JPEG2RLE.py
Input the path of a JPEG and receive the run length encoded values.
It will set the image frame to 100x100 (without cropping or changing aspect ratio) and set the maximum grey levels to 4 (from 256).
The output will be a text file - 'output.rle' -the name can be changed in the script - it could be added to ask for file name quite easily etc.
It will keep running until user exits the program.
